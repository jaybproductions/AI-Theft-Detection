# Raw Data

This folder contains the original, unprocessed video files used for training, validation, and testing.

Examples:
- Surveillance camera footage
- Synthetic theft scenario clips
- Public datasets (if applicable)


❗️❗️❗️add a demo_video.mp4 if no webcam is detected

❗️ Do not modify the contents of this folder directly. All preprocessing should be handled via scripts and saved to `data/processed/`.
