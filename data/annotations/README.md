# Annotations

This folder contains annotation files used for supervised learning and evaluation.

Examples:
- Frame-level action labels (e.g., suspicious, normal)
- Timestamps for labeled events
- Bounding box coordinates (optional)

Annotations should be structured to align with files in `data/raw/` or `data/processed/`, depending on how theyâ€™re used.
